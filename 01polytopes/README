In 2009/2010 I was working on a research project on high-dimensional 0/1
polytopes (i.e., all of whose vertices are in the unit hypercube). We were
interested in, for a given dimension, what was the complexity of the normal
vectors to facets of these polytopes? 

For dimensions <= 3, the normal vectors to 0/1 polytopes are extremely simple,
so there isn't an exact visualization of what is being studied. A reasonable
way to think about it is to consider a regular n-gon in the plane. As n
increases, there are more facets, and the equations defining them become 
more complicated. We're studying something similar where instead of adding
more points, we increase the dimension.

For small dimensions (up to 5 or 6), I was able to reduce the problem by
symmetry and apply brute force to solve it exactly. In higher dimensions, 
there were too many possibilities (this problem grows as 2^2^n). I used
simulated annealing as a heuristic to get reasonable approximations to
the exact solution. From this approximate data we were able to guess the
solution and then confirm it mathematically.
