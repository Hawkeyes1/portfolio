I wrote this code along with one other student as part of an undergraduate
research project in 2008. The project investigated bootstrap percolation, a
topic of current interest in probability. The classic bootstrap percolation
model lives in the 2-dimensional integer lattice. At the beginning, each
point is independently turned on with probability p, otherwise off. Then, 
points that have at least two neighbors on themselves turn on. This process
is repeated until it stabilizes - the question is, what is the probability
that the entire plane has turned on? We analyzed a variant of this problem 
in a higher-dimensional space.

We wrote a prototype in Python, and once we had the simulation working, we 
rewrote in C for speed. 

This work was later incorporated into a paper:
