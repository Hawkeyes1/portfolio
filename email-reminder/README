This was a project I wrote to learn App Engine in 2011. It is an email
reminder - you can type notes or tasks into it and they will be emailed
to you at the time specified. You can also view and edit/delete your existing
reminders.

I took it down after finishing it due to the security concerns of leaving an
unattended site running. Also, it might not work currently if the App Engine
SDK has changed since 2011.
