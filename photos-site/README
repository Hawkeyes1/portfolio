A static site generator for a photo gallery. I wrote this in 2009 to solve
the "my parents don't use Facebook" problem when I wanted to share some
photos with them. (I had no reason not to just use Flickr or something.)

If I were to rewrite this again I'd just use Python and call libraries, as it
would make it easier to make everything more general.

One thing I'm "proud" of is my hacky solution here to only generate small
versions of newly added files - I created a signatures/ folder with an empty
file when I processsed a photo, as a way to store state across runs of the
program. In retrospect I could have just checked for the filename in tiny/.
