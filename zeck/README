Zeck is a combinatorial game. A strategy-stealing argument shows it to be
first-player-win. However, the optimal strategy is not known in general.

This program computes which positions are winning and losing for small cases.

The rules of Zeck are as follows: the board starts as a m x n rectangle of dots:

. . . .
. . . .
. . . .

On your turn, you point to a dot and remove that dot, and anything in the 
upper/right quadrant relative to that point. For instance, if we point here:

. . . .
. . X .
. . . .

then we remove the X and the three points above/right of X, so the board is:

. .
. .
. . . .

The game ends when someone takes the last move, necessarily pointing to the
lower-left corner dot.

Intermediate positions will always be the diagram of a partition, so we
represent them as tuples. For instance, the initial position above is
represented as (4,4,4), and the second position as (4,2,2). For now we would
print these as 444 and 422 for brevity, assuming the user is only checking
single-digit numbers.
